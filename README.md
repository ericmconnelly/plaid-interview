# Plaid Frontend Interview

Thank you for your interest in Plaid!

This interview will be a frontend interview. In preparation for this interview, please have your local web development environment set up so that you can jump right into writing application code for the interview.

You are free to choose any framework you would like, or no framework at all.

For your convenience, we offer two boilerplate templates that you may use: React, and vanilla JS.

## Setup with the React boilerplate
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Setup with the vanilla JS boilerplate
```
npm install
npm run start
```
